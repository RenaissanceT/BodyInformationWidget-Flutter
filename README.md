# Strength Assessment Widget - Flutter
Modern UI engineering is all about components. When we build components to be reusable, 
we enable faster iteration and higher consistency across the application and the company.

This project is to code a small "metrics" widget that we can reuse across different views with Flutter. 
This widget displays a weight and a label. It can be used, for example, in the summary view for a strength assessment.

The basic functions contain "Upper Body", "Core", "Lower Body" three indexes with simply navigation, GestureDetector, 
and slide widgets to detect the motion. This widget also includes a form that allows the user to modify the Label and the Weight to see the widget update as changes are made to the form.
